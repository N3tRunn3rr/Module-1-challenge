# Module-1-challenge
Modele 1 challenge assignment

For the module 1 challenge I went through and made sure everything was in semantic HTML and that everything was labeled correctly.
Some classes needed to be swapped for ids as well as some modifications were made to the CSS to get all the elements to work properly after they had been adjusted in the index.
